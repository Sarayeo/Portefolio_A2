# Hello, I'm Sara and here is a quick explanation about my portfolio 🍪


## First of all how did i intall and initialise my project.
In other to Innitalise my project I first went to use the vercel tool and connected it to my Github account. I then chose my project and imported it on vercel
before deploying it on vercel. By doing so it was there for deployed and my project appeared in the deployment section.
i could  then acces to my portfolio.
After doing so I activated a function checkly located in the running checks tab . I did a new commit and then pushed my new update before checking to see if everything was ok.


## actions installed !
```php
- 🌱 After deploying and activating my checkly I went to my market place and then chose Imgbot action in other 
      to uptimise my website's perfomences with the images

- ⚡ I also decided to add actions , firstly the one recommended imgbot and then mergify, after doing so I went on 
     Zapier and connected Github with a discord solo server that I created just for the case.
     I then created two bots. One for every new commits and another for the creation of new branchs.

```

## Yes it's not over yet
