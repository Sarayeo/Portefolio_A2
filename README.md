# Hello, I'm Sara and here is a quick explanation about my portfolio.


## First of all how did i intall and initialise my project.
In other to Innitalise my project I first went to use the vercel tool and connected it to my Github account. I then chose my project and imported it on vercel
before deploying it on vercel. By doing so it was there for deployed and my project appeared in the deployment section.
i could  then acces to my portfolio.
After doing so I activated a function checkly located in the running checks tab . I did a new commit and then pushed my new update before checking to see if everything was ok.
