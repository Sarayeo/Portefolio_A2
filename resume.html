            <h1>My traits And Working Pace</h1>
             
                <p> As already specified. I am a dynamic person with energy to spare and especially 
                    having the desire to learn.
                    From the home page you may have figure out that I'm a pretty bright person in general
                    and I try my best to retranslate those feelings of fullness around me and true what I do most of the time.
                </p>

                <p> I mentionned liking to cook (mostly baking) as well as drawing.However I also like investing myself in reading
                    swiming and taking pictures on my camera. The three swipping pictures on my home page are a result of it.
                    With the activities stated on the first page all these complement eachother and making who I am wich is very pleasing 
                    and cumforting to me for the time being. 
                </p>
                <p> I like work most of the time efficiently when having a topic in wich I can evest fully in beacause of my liking for it.
                    I don't clearly specialise any programming language for the time being and touch as much as I can to have a full knowlege
                    of the programming languages around me.
                </p>
                <p>Hoping to be working with you soon ,have a great Day.</p>
